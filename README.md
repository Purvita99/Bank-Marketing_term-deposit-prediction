# Domain of the project: Banking
# Objective:
Predicting whether a customer will subscribe a term deposit or not given customer relationship data.
# Problem statment: 
 Analyse the  prior marketing campaigns of the given Portuguese Bank and predict if the user will buy the Bank’s term deposit or not.
# About the dataset:
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
The dataset was picked from UCI Machine Learning Repository.Further details about the list of features in the dataset can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing
# Type of Machine Learning problem:
This is a binary classification problem. Our two classes are “yes” denoting that the customer subscribed to a term deposit, and “no” denoting that the customer did not subscribe.The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y) using various ML techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forests,Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost.
